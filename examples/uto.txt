% uto v1.0

% count 6

. nice. a passing test

! woops! this one failed!
  " comments are attached to whatever line preceded
  " and can span multiple lines

" comments don't have to be indented (nothing does actually). this comment still applies to the failure above

? pending. this lets you know the test was skipped on purpose

. another passing test

( start a group
  % count 3
  . assert 1 + 1 == 2

  ( nested group
    " groups can be nested, but please don't get carried away
  )

  ! assert 0 == 1
) end group

. one more passing test
